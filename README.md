- PhD Evaluation: if this course is taken for credits, the final grade will be determined by
    - 3 problem sets (to be completed in groups of max. 2 participants), weighted 1/4 each,
    - a final exam, weighted 1/4.
- Master Evaluation: TBC
    - 2 problem sets out of 3 (to be completed in groups of max. 2 participants)
    - a final exam, weighted

### Course objectives

- Discuss central methods and current advances in applied econometrics.
- Provide insights into empirical strategies (especially, identification) in important papers in the Labour,
    Public & IO literatures.
- Discuss in-depth a variety of econometric frameworks and their core assumptions for causal and
    counterfactual analysis. Give students an understanding of why and when adding structure informed
    by economic theory can be important.
- Establish basic estimation techniques & numerical methods such as simulation and numerical inte-
    gration.
