    Room).

- PhD: Credit points: 9 ECTS
- Master: Credit points: 6 ECTS
- First session: April 21, 2023
- Final session: July, 14, 2023
- Exam: July, 21, 2023
- Compulsory reading in bold.
- PhD Evaluation: if this course is taken for credits, the final grade will be determined by
    - 3 problem sets (to be completed in groups of max. 2 participants), weighted 1/4 each,
    - a final exam, weighted 1/4.
- Master Evaluation: TBC
    - 2 problem sets out of 3 (to be completed in groups of max. 2 participants)
    - a final exam, weighted

### Course objectives

- Discuss central methods and current advances in applied econometrics.
- Provide insights into empirical strategies (especially, identification) in important papers in the Labour,
    Public & IO literatures.
- Discuss in-depth a variety of econometric frameworks and their core assumptions for causal and
    counterfactual analysis. Give students an understanding of why and when adding structure informed
    by economic theory can be important.
- Establish basic estimation techniques & numerical methods such as simulation and numerical inte-
    gration.

### 2 Omitted Variable Bias, Assessing Models, Fisher Inference, Stata (FW 28.4.)

In this session, we will cover different topics of general interest, before turning to more specific methods.
These are (a) sometimes we are just left with the OLS. Can we learn anything from coefficient movements
and the stability of our estimates when including or excluding more controls?, (b) in this course we will not
talk about inference much but here is one powerful method for inference in experiments (that can also be
applied in non-experimental settings) that works without distributional assumptions, its Fisher inference...,
(c) for both topics we will use Stata, so this is being introduced alongside.

- Assessing endogeneity problems in OLS through coefficient movements
- Fisher inference
- Introduction to Stata software
